## 1. Design Philosophy v0.3.0

**Security ↔ Usability Balance:**
- v0.1.0: Too permissive (easily attacked)
- v0.2.0: Too restrictive (unusable)
- v0.3.0: Tiered approach (security scales with stakes)

**Core Principle:** Low-value decisions = fast + simple. High-value decisions = slow + secure.

---

## 2. Tiered Governance Model

### Tier 1: Fast-Track (Tasks < 100 HBAR)

```yaml
eligibility:
  proposer_reputation: 50+        # Trusted agents only
  max_bounty: 100 HBAR
  
process:
  snapshot_delay: 0               # Immediate
  voting_window: 24h
  reveal_window: 0                # No commit-reveal
  
thresholds:
  quorum: 5% of staked supply
  approval: 3% of total supply
```

**Rationale:** Small tasks don't justify 10-day cycles. Trusted proposers can fast-track.

### Tier 2: Standard (Tasks 100-1000 HBAR)

```yaml
eligibility:
  proposer_stake: 1000 tokens
  max_bounty: 1000 HBAR
  
process:
  snapshot_delay: 24h
  voting_window: 72h (3 days)
  reveal_window: 24h
  
thresholds:
  quorum: 10% of staked supply
  approval: 5% of total supply
```

### Tier 3: High-Stakes (Tasks > 1000 HBAR or Parameter Changes)

```yaml
eligibility:
  proposer_stake: 10000 tokens
  
process:
  snapshot_delay: 72h
  voting_window: 7 days
  reveal_window: 48h
  
thresholds:
  quorum: 15% of staked supply
  approval: 7% of total supply
  super_majority: 10% for parameter changes
```

---

## 3. Simplified Commit-Reveal (Server-Side)

**Problem:** Manual cryptographic commitments = 90% user abandonment.

**Solution:** Bot generates and stores commitments server-side.

```typescript
// User sees:
/vote proposal_123 approve

// Bot handles internally:
async function handleVote(userId: string, proposalId: string, vote: Vote) {
  // 1. Generate salt server-side
  const salt = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');
  
  // 2. Compute commitment
  const commitment = keccak256(encode(vote, salt));
  
  // 3. Store encrypted in secure backend
  await secureStore.save(userId, proposalId, { vote, salt, commitment });
  
  // 4. Submit commitment to HCS
  await hcs.submitCommitment(proposalId, userId, commitment);
  
  // 5. Auto-reveal during reveal window
  scheduleReveal(proposalId, userId, vote, salt);
  
  return "✅ Vote recorded. Will be revealed automatically.";
}
```

**Security Tradeoff:**
- ❌ Users must trust bot with vote secrecy
- ✅ 10x higher participation
- ✅ No lost votes from forgotten reveals
- ✅ No cryptographic knowledge required

**Mitigation:** 
- Open-source bot code
- HCS audit trail proves no tampering
- Optional: power users can submit own commitments

## 4. Sybil Resistance v2

### Multi-Telegram Attack Prevention

**Problem:** Create 20 Telegrams + 20 wallets = 20x voting power.

**Solution:** Phone number verification + new account cooldown.

```typescript
interface LinkedAccount {
  telegramId: string;
  walletAddress: string;
  phoneHash: string;          // Hash of verified phone number
  accountAge: Date;           // Telegram account creation date
  linkDate: Date;
  votingEnabled: boolean;     // False until cooldown passes
}

// Constraints:
const PHONE_LIMIT = 2;              // Max 2 accounts per phone
const ACCOUNT_AGE_MIN = 30;         // Telegram account must be 30+ days old
const LINK_COOLDOWN = 7;            // 7 days before voting enabled
```

**Why This Works:**
- Phone numbers are scarce (cost to acquire)
- Account age requirement blocks mass creation
- Cooldown prevents rapid cycling

**Privacy:** Phone hash never leaves Telegram API; we only get yes/no on uniqueness.

### Wallet Velocity Limits

**Problem:** Whale splits into 10 wallets to bypass cap.

**Solution:** Track wallet relationships via on-chain analysis.

```typescript
interface VotingPowerCheck {
  directPower: number;        // Tokens in this wallet
  relatedPower: number;       // Tokens in related wallets
  totalCappedPower: number;   // After relationship cap applied
}

function getVotingPower(wallet: string): number {
  const direct = getStakedBalance(wallet);
  
  // Detect related wallets via:
  // - Common funding source
  // - High transfer frequency
  // - Registration within same time window
  const related = getRelatedWallets(wallet);
  const totalRelated = related.reduce((sum, w) => sum + getStakedBalance(w), 0);
  
  // Cap TOTAL power across related wallets
  const maxGroupPower = getTotalStaked() * 0.15;  // 15% cap per "group"
  
  return Math.min(direct, maxGroupPower - totalRelated);
}
```

**Note:** Imperfect but raises attack cost significantly.

---

## 5. Limited Emergency Mechanism

**Problem:** v0.2.0 removed all emergency response → 10+ days to fix exploits.

**Solution:** Guardian pause with strict constraints.

```yaml
guardian_pause:
  trigger: 5-of-9 guardian signature
  effect: Freeze all voting for 24h
  max_duration: 24h (non-renewable)
  cooldown: 30 days between pauses
  transparency: Pause reason + guardian votes published immediately
  
  # CANNOT do:
  cannot_change_parameters: true
  cannot_move_funds: true
  cannot_approve_proposals: true
  cannot_extend_pause: true
```

**Why This Is Safe:**
- Can only pause, not act
- Max 24h (one pause, no extensions)
- 30-day cooldown prevents abuse
- Full transparency on who triggered and why

---

## 6. Participation Incentives

**Problem:** Why vote in 10-day cycles for no reward?

**Solution:** Vote-to-earn from protocol fees.

```yaml
participation_rewards:
  source: 1% of bounty releases → reward pool
  distribution: Proportional to voting participation
  
  example:
    monthly_bounties: 10000 HBAR
    reward_pool: 100 HBAR
    active_voters: 50
    avg_reward: 2 HBAR/voter/month
```

**Reputation Bonus:**
```typescript
function getParticipationReward(voter: string): number {
  const baseReward = rewardPool / activeVoters;
  const reputationMultiplier = 1 + (getReputation(voter) / 1000);  // Up to 2x
  const streakBonus = getVotingStreak(voter) * 0.1;  // +10% per consecutive vote
  
  return baseReward * reputationMultiplier * (1 + streakBonus);
}
```

---

## 7. Edge Cases Defined

### Stake Timing

```typescript
// Cannot unstake if:
function canUnstake(wallet: string): boolean {
  // 1. Have active commitment in any proposal
  if (hasActiveCommitment(wallet)) return false;
  
  // 2. Reveal phase pending
  if (hasPendingReveal(wallet)) return false;
  
  // 3. Standard 7-day cooldown
  if (lastStakeTime(wallet) < Date.now() - 7 * DAY) return false;
  
  return true;
}
```

### Failed Reveals

```typescript
// If reveal transaction fails:
const REVEAL_RETRY = 3;           // Auto-retry 3 times
const REVEAL_GAS_BUFFER = 1.5;    // 50% extra gas on retry

// If still fails:
function handleFailedReveal(userId: string, proposalId: string) {
  // 1. Mark vote as "reveal_failed" (not counted)
  // 2. NO slashing (network issues aren't user's fault)
  // 3. Refund any reveal fee
  // 4. Notify user
}
```

### Tie Resolution

```typescript
// If approve === deny after reveal:
function resolveTie(proposalId: string): Outcome {
  // Status quo wins (deny)
  return Outcome.DENIED;
}
```

---

## 8. Guardian Selection (Concrete)

### Initial Guardians (Bootstrap)

```yaml
# First 9 guardians selected by:
initial_selection:
  - 3 from Fly ecosystem team
  - 3 from top reputation agents
  - 3 from community nomination (first governance vote)
  
# Criteria:
requirements:
  min_stake: 10000 tokens
  min_reputation: 100
  identity_verified: true
  no_previous_slashing: true
```

### Rotation Mechanism

```yaml
guardian_rotation:
  term_length: 6 months
  max_consecutive_terms: 2
  
  election_process:
    nomination_period: 14 days
    voting_period: 7 days
    threshold: Tier 3 (high-stakes)
    
  emergency_removal:
    trigger: 7-of-9 guardians OR 25% of total supply vote
    effect: Immediate removal, election within 30 days
```

*End of Specification v0.3.0*

**Key Tradeoffs:**
- Server-side commit-reveal: Trust bot vs. unusable UX → chose usability
- Phone verification: Privacy vs. sybil resistance → chose resistance with hash privacy
- Tiered governance: Complexity vs. one-size-fits-all → chose appropriate security per stakes

**Review Status:** Ready for Round 3 scrutiny
